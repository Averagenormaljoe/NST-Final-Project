# StyleMotion - A Model with a Interactive User Interface for Filmmakers

## Overview

StyleMotion is a real-time neural style transfer model that supports real-time, multi-neural style transfer, image-based and video-based style transfer. It can process videos up tp 900\*900 resolution.

## Models

### AdaIN Model (StyleMotion)

The StyleMotion model is based on the [ReCoNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01197) and the [AdaIN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868).

### Gatys et al. Model

The Gatys model is based on the [Gatys et al. paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

### Johnson et al. Model

The Johnson model is based on the [Johnson et al. paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155).

## Huang et al. Model

The Huang model is based on the paper.

## Model locations

AdaIN is stored in the 'AdaIN/' directory.

The gatys model is stored in the 'main_protoype/' directory

The Huang model is stored in the 'Huang/' directory.

The Johnson al et model is stroed in the ''

This uses the models created in the project and supplied them to an user interface for users to interact with. Currently, this is stored on another repository called: "https://github.com/Averagenormaljoe/NST-Streamlit-website".
