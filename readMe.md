# StyleMotion - A Model with a Interactive User Interface for Filmmakers

## Overview

StyleMotion is a real-time neural style transfer model that supports real-time, multi-neural style transfer, image-based and video-based style transfer. It can process videos up tp 900\*900 resolution.

## Models

### AdaIN Model (StyleMotion)

### Gatys et al. Model

### Johnson et al. Model

## Huang et al. Model

## Streamlit website

This uses the models created in the project and supplied them to an user interface for users to interact with. Currently, this is stored on another repository called: "https://github.com/Averagenormaljoe/NST-Streamlit-website".
