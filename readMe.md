# StyleMotion - A Model with a Interactive User Interface for Filmmakers

## Overview

StyleMotion is a real-time neural style transfer model that supports real-time, multi-neural style transfer, image-based and video-based style transfer. It can process videos up tp 900\*900 resolution.

## Models

### AdaIN Model (StyleMotion)

The StyleMotion model is based on the [ReCoNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01197) and the [AdaIN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868).

### Gatys et al. Model

The Gatys model is based on the [Gatys et al. paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

### Johnson et al. Model

The Johnson model is based on the [Johnson et al. paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155).

## Huang et al. Model

The Huang model is based on the [Huang et al. paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868).

## Streamlit Website

This uses the models created in the project and supplied them to an user interface for users to interact with. This is setup using the Streamlit library Currently, the code for this is stored on
another repository called: [https://stylemotion-app.streamlit.app/]("https://github.com/Averagenormaljoe/NST-Streamlit-website").

You can visit the website, which is running from this link:

[https://stylemotion-app.streamlit.app/](https://stylemotion-app.streamlit.app/).

Note if the project is asleep due to inactivity, press the 'Yes, get this app back up!' button to
restart it.

## Model locations

AdaIN is stored in the 'AdaIN/' directory.

The gatys model is stored in the 'main_protoype/' directory

The Huang model is stored in the 'Huang/' directory.

The Johnson al et model is stroed in the 'forward_feed/' directory.
